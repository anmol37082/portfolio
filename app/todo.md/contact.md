Contact Section (Get in Touch / Hire Me)

This is the final and most action-oriented section of your advanced portfolio — it converts visitors into leads, clients, or employers.
Your goal here: make it super easy for anyone to contact you instantly.

🔹 Structure of the Contact Section

Include 3 parts for a professional setup 👇

🗺️ 1. Contact Information

Show your main communication channels clearly:

📍 Location: Chak 8KB, Anupgarh, Rajasthan

📧 Email: singanmol714@gmail.com

📱 Phone: +91-9982667732 / 7851037082

🔗 LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/anmol37082

🐙 GitHub: github.com/anmol37082

✅ Tip: Use icons + clickable links.

💌 2. Contact Form (Interactive Form)

Let visitors send messages directly through your site.

Form Fields:

Name

Email

Subject

Message

Backend Logic (MERN Integration):

Use Express + Nodemailer to send form data as an email to your inbox.

Optionally, save messages in MongoDB (for admin panel view).

Use Axios in React to send POST requests to /api/contact.

Example:

// backend/routes/contact.js
router.post("/", async (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, message } = req.body;
  await Contact.create({ name, email, message });
  res.status(200).json({ success: true });
});

🌐 3. Social Media Links / Footer CTA

At the bottom, add:

Buttons for GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, or X (Twitter)

A line like:

“Open for freelance projects and collaborations — Let’s build something amazing 🚀”

🔹 Design Tips

Use a two-column layout — left side contact info, right side form.

Add subtle animation on hover for icons and buttons.

Use form validation (React Hook Form + Toastify for success message).

Make sure it’s mobile-friendly and easy to scroll to from your navbar.
