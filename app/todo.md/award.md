Awards / Honors Section (Optional but Impactful)

This section highlights recognition you’ve received — competitions, hackathons, scholarships, or special mentions. It adds social proof and makes your portfolio stand out, especially if you’re a fresher or early career MERN developer.

🔹 Structure

Each award or honor card can include:

🏆 Title of Award / Recognition — e.g., Hackathon Winner 2024

🏫 Issuing Organization / Platform — e.g., Sharda College

📅 Date Received

📜 Short Description / Achievement (optional)

Logo / Badge (optional) — adds visual appeal

🔹 Example Layout

🏆 Hackathon Winner 2024
Sharda College, Anupgarh
📅 Dec 2024

Led a team to build a real-time food ordering app in 24 hours using MERN stack.

🎖️ Best Full-Stack Project Award
The Skill Boost, Chandigarh
📅 Apr 2025

🔹 Design Tips

Use grid layout for multiple awards

Add icons or small medal graphics for visual appeal

Highlight top 1–2 awards more prominently

Include hover animations for interactivity

Make it responsive — stack vertically on mobile

💡 Pro Idea:
Combine Achievements + Awards + Certifications in one visually clean section using tabs or cards, so the section is compact but still informative.
