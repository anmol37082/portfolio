9. Education Section (Academic Background)

Even in an advanced MERN stack portfolio, your education helps show credibility — especially when you're early in your career or switching fields.
Keep it clean, minimal, and professional 👇

🔹 Structure of the Education Section

Each education card or timeline entry should include:

🎓 Degree / Course Name — e.g. Bachelor of Science in Computer Science

🏫 College / University Name — e.g. Sharda College, Anupgarh

📅 Duration — e.g. 2022 – 2025

🧩 Highlights or Achievements (optional) — e.g. Top 5% of class, built 3+ full-stack projects

(Optional) Certifications / Training — like “MERN Stack Certification from The Skill Boost, Chandigarh”
